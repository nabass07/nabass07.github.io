I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, part 2 
was one of my favorite labs to do because it’s my favorite card game to play. It allowed me to write functions that simulated how a blackjack game is played. I found it to be very enjoyable and it will go down as one of my favorites.

* Lab 3, part 1 
was very enjoyable because it had to do with specific math calculations. I found this interesting because it shows how math equations can be translated into computer code and be solved autonomously. I found it very interesting to see how math can be used for more than just outputs with words.

* Lab 11, part 2 
is a favorite of mine because it dealt with programming a simple game to play. It utilized if-else statements and taught me a lot about coding as a whole. It also helped to further establish my learning of the subject.
